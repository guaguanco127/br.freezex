## What's New in 1.2

- **Much lower CPU.** The spectral processing now switches itself off completely while the freeze is bypassed, and back on the moment you freeze. Resting CPU dropped to about 1%, and about 4% while freezing.
- **Smooth bloom into the freeze.** Turning the freeze on keeps the dry sound playing until the first frozen sound arrives, then crossfades from the dry sound into the freeze over the Crossfade time. Turning it off crossfades straight back to the dry sound, with no gap.
- **Fresher freezes at any sample rate.** The moment a freeze is captured is now worked out from the sample rate, so each freeze contains only sound from after you pressed it.
- **Lighter transient detector** (it polls the input less often; detection speed is unchanged).
- Retrigger and Transient Detect still capture the exact moment they fire.

## <a name="About"></a>About

This is a spectral Max/MSP abstraction that allows the user to do a spectral freeze of a stereo signal. Additionally, a transient detector option is available. This contains all features available within [br.freeze](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.freeze), except this version allows the user to crossfade into the next freeze between 50 ms and 10 seconds.

Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.

Only works as an abstraction or a device. External objects and RNBO not available yet. An extremely important file is included in each folder called "br.solofreeze.pfft" do not move or delete this file until you follow all instructions for installation. 
  
**Freeze:** On/Off, Bypass or Freeze.  
**Retrigger:** When the freeze is on, this will freeze the current stereo signal. 
**Crossfade:** Determines the duration of time it takes to crossfade from one freeze to the next. The lowest is 50 ms, the highest is 10,000 ms (10 seconds). An additional freeze cannot be started until the crossfade is completed.  
**Mix Modes:** "Insert" interrupts the signal with the freeze, while "Gate" only allows the freeze to sound without passing through the dry signal during bypass.    
**Transient Detect:** When both "Freeze" and "Transient Detect" are on, the freeze will occur automatically based on the transient detection sensitivity settings. Detections cannot occur faster than 100 ms.   
**Transient Detect Sensitivity:** When both "Freeze" and "Transient Detect" are on, this will determine how sensitive the transient detection is. Between 0. and 1., 0. is the lowest sensitivity, while 1. is the most sensitive. 

## <a name="Abstraction"></a>What is an Abstraction?

An abstraction is a subpatcher that is saved as an external file, and can be used just like a standard Max object. As long as your abstraction can be found in the Max file path, you can type its name into a new object box and it will be loaded directly into your patch.  

By saving your logic in an abstraction, you can create modules that can be used in future work with little or no additional programming. This allows you to parlay your Max knowledge into more efficient work in the future, and will help you create programming systems that are modular and easier to maintain.

## <a name="Install"></a>How To Install

1. Make sure you have Max 9 installed in your computer. And, make sure you are using a Max patch that is inside of a folder.  

2. Copy and paste br.freezex.abs.1.2.maxpat inside of the same folder as the Max patch you are using. 

3. Also, copy and paste the file called br.solofreeze.pfft into the same folder. If this file is already there, then there is no reason to copy and paste it. **The abstraction will not work without this file.**     

4. In the Max patch you are using, create an object called br.freezex.abs.1.2 

5. Alternatively, you could also create this inside of a bpatcher object and use all of the preset UI objects featured inside the abstraction. To do this, create a bpatcher object. Then, go inside of its inspector, select "choose" next to "Patcher File" and select the br.freezex.abs.1.2.maxpat located within the same folder as your project. 


## <a name="Use"></a>How To Use

The first two inlets are for the left and the right stereo signals. The two outlets are the left and right outputs.

Every control has its own inlet. Sending a value to an inlet moves its on-screen control too, so the display always matches the sound. Hover over an inlet in Max to see the same information.

| Inlet | Control | Type | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Left audio in | Signal | | |
| 2 | Right audio in | Signal | | |
| 3 | Freeze | Int | 0 = Bypass, 1 = Freeze | 0 |
| 4 | Retrigger | Bang |  |  |
| 5 | Crossfade | Float | 50 - 10000 ms | 2500 |
| 6 | Mix Mode | Int | 0 = Insert, 1 = Gate | 0 |
| 7 | Transient Detect | Int | 0 = Off, 1 = On | 0 |
| 8 | Sensitivity | Float | 0 - 1 | 0.5 |

Turning the freeze on crossfades from the dry sound into the freeze over the Crossfade time. Retrigger freezes a new moment while the freeze is on and crossfades into it over the Crossfade time; another retrigger can't happen until that crossfade is complete. Retrigger does nothing while bypassed. Transient detections cannot occur faster than 100 ms.

Double click on the object and you can see inside of the object. This way you can study how it was built.

## <a name="Version"></a>Version History  

Version 1.2 lowered CPU use (the spectral processing switches off while bypassed), made turning the freeze on and off gap-free (on crossfades from the dry sound over the Crossfade time), timed each freeze from the sample rate, and lightened the transient detector.  
Version 1.1 fixed an issue with stereo and using multiple instances of the abstraction
